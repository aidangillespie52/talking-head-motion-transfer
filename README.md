# Talking-Head Motion Transfer

This repository will implement and evaluate a recent talking-head motion transfer method.
The goal is to provide a clean, minimal inference pipeline built on top of an existing
research implementation.

This project is currently under active development.

## Scope
- Replicate a published talking-head motion transfer approach
- Focus on inference and reproducibility
- Add a small extension or analysis once the baseline is working
